# Bioinformatics-Python
Uses Biopython and matplotlib to read in and parse two Fasta sequences and create a sequence allignment dot plot 
with a window of ten and requriing at least five matching nucleotides. 

Testing:
Download the two fasta files included: HXK2_HUMAN.fasta & HXK2_MOUSE.fasta

In a Linux environment:
  Call the python file and pass the two fasta files as arguments
  The graph will be generated in a pop up window
  
 Understanding the results:
   Dots show areas of similarities between the two sequences
   A diaganol line through the middle indicates high sequence similarity
   If you compare a sequence to itself you will see an unbroken diagonal line
